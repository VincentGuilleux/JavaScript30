    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); // 200 100 => because the value of age goes into the variable definition age2 at the same time

    let name = 'Wes';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2);
    name = 'wesley';
    console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    team[3] = 'Lux'; // when updating an array it will always reference back to the original array so in this case players will be updated as well
    console.log(players, team);
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    // one way
    const players2 = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players2, team2);
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players2);
    team3[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players2, team3);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players2, team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players2, team5);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };
    console.log(person);

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;
    console.log(person, captain);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person2 = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person2, { number: 99, age: 12 });
    console.log(person2, cap2);

    // Or use ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person2};
    cap3.number = 99;
    console.log(person2, cap3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };

    console.log(wes);
    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    // 1-level deep update: OK dev is updated but not wes
    dev.name = 'Wesley';
    console.log(wes, dev)
    // 2-level deep update: dev AND wes twitter are updated because Object.assign ONLY GOES ONE LEVEL DEEP. In such cases, use the cloneDeep method.
    dev.social.twitter = '@coolman';
    console.log(wes, dev)
    // The poor man's way to circumvent this issue can be as follows:
    const wes2 = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
    console.log(wes2, dev2)
